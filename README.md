# MachineLearning Solution

Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programed. Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

I am using this Machine Learning Solution using sample infamous Titanic dataset.

### Source of dataset taken from here - https://www.kaggle.com/pavlofesenko/titanic-extended

- Dataset Dictionary is captured below
  - We have given 3 files : full data, train and test data
  - Train data : we will be using this to build our machine learning solution with algorithm(s)
  - Test data : we will be using this to verify / test our model or solution that we have developed using train data

Variable / Field           | Definition             | Description / More Details           |
:--                        |:--                     |:--                                   |
survival                   | Survival               | 0 = No, Not Survived and 1 = Yes, Survived |
pclass                     | Passenger Class        | 1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class. This is the class in which passenger were placed in the ship |
sex                        | Sex/Gender             | 1 = Male, 0 = Female                 |
age                        | Age in years           | Age of the particular person         |
sibsp                      | # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic | Can be 1,2,3 etc        |
parch                      | # of parents / children aboard the Titanic | Can be 1,2,3 etc        |
ticket                     | Ticket number          | Ticket number                        |

### Tools and IDE (Integrated Development Environment) used - Python, Jupyter Notebook
