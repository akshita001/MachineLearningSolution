# MachineLearning Solution

Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programed. Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

I am using this Machine Learning Solution using sample infamous Titanic dataset.
